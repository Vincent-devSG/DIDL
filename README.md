# Start of Dive into Deep Learning

## Summary
This repository is a collection of my notes and code implementations from the book **Dive into Deep Learning** by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alexander J. Smola. The book is available online at [d2l.ai](https://d2l.ai/).
I have chosen to study the PyTorch implementation version of the book.

### Notes Folder
Additionnaly, there this is the folder I'll put my **notes**:
[Notes](https://github.com/Vincent-devSG/DIDL/tree/main/notes)

### Projects Folder
And the folder where I'll do small **projects** as I advance in the book:
[Projects](https://github.com/Vincent-devSG/DIDL/tree/main/projects)
