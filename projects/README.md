First project: **Linear Regression** from scratch.

- Part 1:  
I want to implement the linear regression model from scratch, using only numpy and pandas.  
I made used jupyter notebook to explore the data. I useed the data from kaggle: [Graduate Admission](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions/data).

List of things I done:
- [x] Load the data.
- [x] Explore the data.
- [x] Clean the data. (No work needed)
- [x] Visualize the data.
- [x] GetData module to get the training and testing splits.

List of ameliorations to do:
- [ ] Evaluate the model.
- [ ] Pipeline.
- [ ] Add more visualizations.
- [ ] Add Generalization, Weight Decay, K-Fold Cross Validation.

- Part 2:
I want to implement the linear regression model from scratch, using PyTorch.
